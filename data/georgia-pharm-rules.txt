Rule 480 -5-.03. Code of Professional Conduct.  The Board is authorized to take disciplinary action for unprofessional conduct. Consistent with 
the authority to assure that licensees operate in a professional manner and the Board's 
responsibility to protect the public health with a safe, dependable and sufficient supply of 
medication, the Board establishes a Code of Professional Conduct which shall apply to and be 
observed by all persons engaged in the practice of pharmacy in the State of Georgia.  
(a) Ethics. No pharmacist, intern, extern, technician, or pharmacy owner shall engage in any 
conduct in the practice of pharmacy or in the operation of a pharmacy which tends to 
reduce the public confidence in the ability and integrity of the profession of pha rmacy, or 
endangers the public health, safety and welfare, or have been guilty of any fraud, 
misrepresentation, culpable negligence, concealment, dishonest dealings, fix, scheme or 
device, or breach of trust in the practice of pharmacy or in the conduction  of business 
related to prescriptions, drugs or devices.  
(b) Patient Self -Referral. No pharmacist, employee or agent thereof acting on his/her behalf, 
shall offer, agree to accept, or receive compensation in any form for the referral of 
professional services to or from another health care provider or entity. This pr ohibition 
includes any form of fee division or charging of fees for the referral of patients.  
(c) Error or Uncertain Prescriptions. No pharmacist or pharmacy intern/extern shall 
compound or dispense any prescription, which, in his/her professional opinion, contains 
any error omission, irregularity or ambiguity. Upon receipt of such prescription, the 
pharmacist, pharmacy intern/extern shall contact the prescriber and confer with him/her 
before dispensing the prescription. No pharmacist or intern/extern shall dispense any 
medication by virtue of a prescription if said pharmacist or intern has any doubt ex isting 
in his mind that such prescription is not legitimate.  
(d) Betrayal of Confidence. A pharmacist shall not discuss with the patient or representative 
such matters that should be discussed only with the prescriber.  
(e) Diagnosis or Treatment. No pharmacist or employee of a pharmacy shall diagnose, treat, 
prescribe for, or attempt to do so, any disease, illness, or organic disorder. This limitation 
shall not be construed to prevent a licensed pharmacist from advising indi viduals on 
matters concerning simple ailments, first aid measures, sanitary matters, or the merits and 
qualities of medicines, nor shall it prevent the full practice of pharmacy as provided in 
O.C.G.A. Section 26-4-4. 
(f) Coded Prescriptions. No pharmacist, pharmacy intern, or extern shall compound or 
dispense any prescription that is coded. A "coded" prescription is one which bears letters, 
numbers, words or symbols, or any other device used in lieu of the name, quantity, 
strength and directors for its use, other than normal letters, numbers, words, symbols or 
other media recognized by the profession of pharmacy as a means for conveying 
information by prescription. No symbol, word or any other device shall be used in lieu o f 
the name of said preparation.  (g) False or Misleading Advertising. No pharmacist or licensed pharmacy shall disseminate 
through any communication media any false, misleading or fraudulent advertising.  
(h) Changes in Prescriptions. No pharmacist, pharmacy intern or extern shall supply 
medications or devices which contain an ingredient or article different in any manner 
from the medication or device that is prescribed upon a prescription unless prior approval  
has been obtained from the prescriber thereof. Such difference shall immediately be 
recorded upon said prescription after being approved by said prescriber, showing the date, 
time and method of ascertaining the said approval.  
(i) Prescription Sub -Stations. No pharmacist, employer or employee of a licensed pharmacy 
shall maintain a location, other than a pharmacy for which a permit has been issued by the 
Board, from which to solicit, accept or dispense prescriptions.  
(j) Physician Agreements. No pharmacist or licensed pharmacy, or employee or agent 
thereof, shall enter into or engage in any agreement or arrangement with an physician or 
other practitioner for the payment or acceptance of compensation in any form or type for  
the recommending of the professional services of either; or enter into a rebate or 
percentage rental agreement if any kind, whereby in any way a patient's free choice of a 
pharmacist or licensed pharmacy is or may be limited.  
(k) Independent Judgment and Practices. No pharmacist shall offer or engage in professional 
pharmaceutical services under any terms and conditions that shall tend to interfere with or 
impair the free and complete exercise of professional judgment and skill of a pharmacist 
or enter into any agreement that denies the public the right of free choice of pharmacists 
or pharmacies.  
(l) Return of Prescriptions. Except as authorized by Rule 480-10-.17, no pharmacist or 
employer or employee of a pharmacy may knowingly place in the stock of any pharmacy 
any part of any prescription dispensed to, or compounded for, any patient of any 
pharmacy and returned by said patient.  
(m) Evasion of Code of Professional Conduct. No pharmacist, licensed pharmacy or 
employee or agent thereof, shall act in any way to evade the rules and regulations of the 
Board and the laws applying to licensed pharmacies and pharmacists, interns, externs 
and technicians, but may apply methods of the ir own to enhance compliance with said 
laws, rules and regulations. Said persons shall be responsible for being acquainted with 
said laws, rules and regulations, and ignorance of said laws, rules, regulations shall not 
be a valid defense of the same.  
(n) Refusal to Fill Prescription. It shall not be considered unprofessional conduct for any 
pharmacist to refuse to fill any prescription based on his/her professional judgment or 
ethical or moral beliefs.  
(o) Valid Prescription Drug Orders. Prescription drugs shall be dispensed only pursuant to a 
valid prescription drug order. A pharmacist shall not dispense a prescription which the 
pharmacist knows or should know is not a valid prescription. A pharmacist shall  have the same corresponding liability for prescriptions as an issuing practitioner as set forth in 21 
C.F.R. as such regulation exists on January 1, 2013. Valid prescription drug orders shall 
include those issued by a physician, dentist, podiatrist, veterinarian, o r other person 
licensed, registered, or otherwise authorized under the laws of this state, or of any state or 
territory of the United States, to prescribe dangerous drugs or controlled substances or 
both.  
(p) Violations of the Code of Professional Conduct. The above set out Code of Professional 
Conduct is expressly adopted by the Board and shall govern the conduct of all those 
admitted to practice pharmacy in their capacities as pharmacists, all those issued li censes 
as a pharmacy in their capacities as licensees and all pharmacy interns/externs in their 
capacities as pharmacy interns/externs. A license to practice pharmacy or a permit to 
operate a licensed pharmacy confers to vested right to the holder thereof,  but is a 
conditional privilege revocable for cause. The primary purpose of this Code of 
Professional Conduct is the protection of the profession of pharmacy and the public 
health, safety and welfare. It is the responsibility of the Board to purge the prof ession of 
those unworthy to practice pharmacy or operate pharmacies in this state. It is the 
obligation of every licensed pharmacy holder and every licensed pharmacist to give 
unlimited cooperation and assistance to the Board in the discharge of this respo nsibility. 
Violation of this code may subject the violator to suspension or revocation of any license 
issued to him/her by the Board and/or public reprimand, fines, probation, letters of 
concern or other disciplinary actions deemed appropriate by the Board .

Rule 480 -10-.16. Security System Approval.  
As set forth by O.C.G.A. 26-4-110, the Board may provide in its rules and regulations the 
manner in which the prescription department of a retail pharmacy may be secured. This 
requirement will be met in the following manner:  
(1) Any retail pharmacy located in a general merchandising establishment which does not 
have a prescription department set aside and permanently enclosed with a partition from 
floor to ceiling as set forth in O.C.G.A. 26-4-110, must submit to the Board in writing a 
request to approve its particular security system accompanied by a detailed description of 
that security system. This request must be made prior to a pharmacy receiving its retail 
pharmacy permit;  
(a) Any retail pharmacy located in a general merchandising establishment which 
chooses to close its prescription department for more than three (3) hours per day, 
and more than one and one half (1 1/2) hours at any one time, MUST have its 
prescription departme nt permanently enclosed with a partition from floor to 
ceiling;  
(b) Any retail pharmacy located in a general merchandising establishment in which 
the prescription department is not permanently enclosed and utilizes ONLY an 
electronic security system to separate the prescription department from the rest of 
the business esta blishment, MAY NOT close for more than three (3) hours per 
day, nor more than one and one half (1 1/2) hours at any one time. Board approval 
of a pharmacy's electronic security system, without the presence of a permanent 
partition, does not exempt a pharma cy from this requirement.  
 
(2) Each security system description shall be reviewed and either approved or disapproved by 
the Board.  (3) The Board shall notify the pharmacy submitting the security description in writing as to 
whether or not the Board approves or disapproves the system. In cases in which a system 
is not approved, the Board may submit suggestions or reasons as to why the syst em was 
not acceptable.  
(4) Upon receiving a written approval of a security system, a pharmacy MUST maintain a 
copy of the Board's approval letter, along with a copy of the security system description, 
making both available in the pharmacy for inspection by the GDNA. This requirement  
can be met by posting the approval letter with the last GDNA inspection report.  
(5) Any change in a security system must first be approved in writing by the Board and a 
copy of the approval maintained by the pharmacy.  
(6) In the case of multiple retail pharmacies being operated by a parent corporation, the 
parent corporation may submit a request for a blanket approval of the same security 
system to be used by all pharmacies operated by that corporation. A copy of the writte n 
Board approval and the system description must be maintained at each pharmacy 
operated by the corporation. Thereafter, any new pharmacy operated by that corporation 
may utilize the same security system which was previously approved by the Board.  
(7) Whenever a corporation or business entity operates multiple pharmacies, each of which 
has a secured prescription department, whether or not it is an electronically secured or 
permanently enclosed area, the pharmacist in charge (PIC) shall develop a method,  
approved by the Board, of allowing authorized access to that area. This method may 
consist of a Board approved lockbox containing a key, security access code, or other 
means by which security is maintained. Nothing in this rule is meant to prevent the PIC  
from having the authority to limit access to such area in regards to non -pharmacy related 
persons.  
(a) Before any such pharmacy can utilize a method of such access, a description of 
this method, including details of any lockbox to be utilized, must be submitted to 
the Board for approval.  
1. A corporation or business entity may choose to utilize the same method of 
access to secure a key or access code for each pharmacy it operates in the 
State of Georgia by notifying the Board in writing. A copy of the Board 
approved method must be attached to  the last GDNA inspection report. Any 
change in such method must be approved by the Board.  
 
(b) Upon approving or disapproving a method, the Board will notify the pharmacy of 
such in writing. A copy of such approvals must be posted by the pharmacy with 
the last GDNA inspection report. When a method is not approved, the Board may 
offer suggestions as to what must be done before the method can be approved.  
 
(8) All pharmacies licensed on or after January 1, 2006 that utilize a drive -through system for 
the delivery of drugs, or any currently licensed pharmacy that relocates or has 
construction or modification of the pharmacy or pharmacy department on or after January 1, 2006 that creates a drive -through or alters an existing drive -through system for delivery 
of drugs, must submit the construction and security plans for utilization of a pharmacy 
drive -through to the Board before such construction or modification, and an y such drive -
through must be approved by the Board and must meet the requirements set forth herein. 
For purposes of this rule, a pharmacy drive -through is a delivery method by which a 
patient, or their designated agent, hereafter referred to as "patient", leaves a prescription 
to be filled or receives a filled prescription drug at the licensed pharmacy location other 
than by physically being inside the pharmacy.  
(a) Any Pharmacy Drive -Through must include a window of transparent material, 
measuring no less than 2 X 3 feet. The window must be placed in a wall of the 
prescription department or pharmacy. A pharmacist must be able to observe the 
patient through the window , whether or not the patient is in a drive -through lane 
directly next to the window or in a drive -through lane which is one lane over from 
the window. There shall be no more than two drive -through lanes with the lane 
farthest from the pharmacy/prescription  department drive -through window being 
no more than twenty -four feet from the window.  
(b) Any Pharmacy Drive -Through that utilizes a pneumatic tube system, through 
which prescription drug orders are received from the patient or prescription drugs 
are dispensed to the patient, must meet the following standards:  
1. Secured carriers must be utilized in the pneumatic tube system;  
2. Tubes must be constructed in a manner as to prevent access by unauthorized 
persons;  
3. The tube must originate in the prescription drug area of the pharmacy, be 
accessible only by a pharmacist or personnel in the pharmacy and must 
terminate in a secure terminal in the drive -through.  
 
(c) Access to the pneumatic tube system must be constructed in such a way as to 
provide protection from the natural elements for the patient accessing the 
prescription.  
(d) Any Pharmacy Drive -Through must be inspected by a GDNA Special Agent prior 
to utilization. Such Special Agent must file an inspection report with the Board 
with a recommendation for approval or non -approval.  
 
(9) All pharmacies licensed prior to January 1, 2006 that utilize drive -throughs that do not 
comply with subsection 8(a) through (d) shall be grandfathered in.

regional poison control information center shall be readily available in areas outside the 
pharmacy where these drugs are stored.

requirement of having an on -site pharmacist to provide routine pharmacy services within 
the hospital in order to qualify as a licensed pharmacy.

II (C -II) controlled drug is necessary, there is no appropriate alternative treatment or drug 
in a schedule less than CII, and it is not reasonably possible for the practitioner to provide 
a written prescription drug order for the pharmacist dispensing the drug prior to issuance. 
Such emergency prescription drug order is permissib le provided that:

insure the practitioner's identity; and  
(d) Within 7 days after authorizing an emergency oral prescription drug order, the 
prescribing practitioner shall cause a written prescription drug order to be 
delivered to the dispensing pharmacist for the emergency quantity prescribed. In 
addition to conform ing to the requirements of Rule 480-22-.03, the prescription 
shall have written on its face "Authorization for Emergency Dispensing," and the 
date of the oral order.

prescription drug order, which had earlier been reduced to writing. The 
pharmacist shall notify the Georgia Drugs and Narcotics Agency, if the 
prescribing practitioner fails to deliver a written prescription drug ord er to 
the dispensing pharmacist.

prescription.  
(b) The facsimile serves as the original, written prescription drug order for purposes 
of this paragraph, and it shall be maintained in accordance with Rule 480-22-
.04(7)  and this chapter. After transmission of the original prescription, the

the patient's agent, to the dispensing pharmacy by facsimile ma chine or equipment.  
(a) The practitioner, practitioner's agent, or pharmacist will note on the prescription 
drug order that the patient is a LTCF patient by writing "LTCF" on the face of the 
prescription.  
(b) In addition to the term LTCF being noted on the face of the prescription, 
whenever a practitioner's agent transmits or a pharmacist receives such a 
prescription, the name of the agent and the practitioner's telephone number or the 
name and license number of the pharma cist must be included on the face of the 
prescription. This information may be used for verification of the prescription 
drug order.  
(c) The facsimile serves as the original, written prescription drug order for purposes 
of this paragraph (c), and it shall be maintained in accordance with Rule 480-22-
.04(a)  and this chapter. After transmission of the original prescription, the 
pharmacist should suggest that the practitioner mark "VOID" across the face of the

drug order.  
(c) The facsimile serves as the original, written prescription drug order for purposes 
of this paragraph, and it shall be maintained in accordance with Rule 480-22-
.04(a)  and this chapter. After transmission of the original prescription drug order, 
the pharmacist should suggest that the practitioner mark "VOID" across the face of 
the prescription, and that it be maintained by the practitioner in the patient's 
medical chart . 
 
(7) Record keeping for Schedule II Controlled Substances shall be as follows:  
(a) Original and all other hard copy schedule II (C -II) prescription drug orders shall 
be maintained in a separate file from all other prescription drug orders.  
(b) Whenever a pharmacy utilizes a computerized record keeping system in addition 
to hard copies to record the dispensing of prescription drug orders for C -II drugs, 
such records shall be immediately retrievable without delay in a printout form by 
the prescrib ing practitioner's name, patient's name, drug name or date of 
dispensing upon a verbal request from a representative of the Georgia Drugs and 
Narcotics Agency (GDNA), and/or one of its agents.  
 
(8) Whenever a pharmacist receives a prescription for a C -II controlled substance, and either 
the quantity of the drug to be dispensed or the strength of the drug to be dispensed has not 
been included by the prescribing practitioner, or when the strength of th e prescribed drug 
is not immediately available, in order to dispense this drug, the pharmacist must perform 
the following:  
(a) Contact and speak directly with the practitioner, not with an agent for the 
practitioner, and inform the practitioner of the missing information on the face of 
the prescription, or the problem with the prescription in question by:  
1. Determining the quantity of the drug the practitioner intended to be 
dispensed; or  
2. Determining the strength of the drug the practitioner intended to be 
dispensed; or  
3. Informing the practitioner the drug in the strength prescribed is not 
immediately available, but another strength of the prescribed drug is 
available.  
 
(b) Regarding the information provided by the practitioner, the pharmacist must write 
the missing quantity, the missing strength, or the changed quantity and strength of 
the prescribed drug on the face of the prescription along with the initials of the 
pharmac ist. (c) On the back of the prescription, the pharmacist must write the date and time the 
pharmacist spoke with the practitioner, along with a brief explanation of the 
situation and how it was resolved.  
(d) Nothing in this rule is intended to require a pharmacist in a hospice or LTCF 
setting to obtain a new prescription drug order when changes are made to a 
patient's dosing requirements. This action may be taken as long as the pharmacist 
verifies the change(s ) with the practitioner and makes a notation of the change(s) 
along with the date of the change(s) on the original hardcopy prescription drug 
order.  
 
(9) A Schedule II narcotic controlled substance prescription prepared in accordance with 
Rule 480-22-.03 and as defined by O.C.G.A. § 16-13-26, to be compounded for the direct

Rule 480 -27-.05. Record -Keeping When Utilizing an Automated Data 
Processing System.  
In order to comply with the record keeping requirements of this Chapter, an automated electronic 
data processing system may be utilized for the record keeping system if the following conditions 
have been met:  
(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all original prescriptions, those hard copies written 
by a practitioner, telephoned to the pharmacist by a practitioner and reduced to writing, or 
sent via facsimile machine or other electronic means must be retained as  a permanent 
record for two years in the usual consecutively serial numbered prescription file. Any 
refill information subsequently authorized by a practitioner must be maintained in the 
manner required by O.C.G.A. § 26-4-80(e) . 
(b) The system shall at a minimum produce sight -readable records for all dangerous drug and 
controlled substance prescriptions filled or refilled during each 24 -hour period. The term 
"sight -readable" means that a representative of the Board or GDNA shall be ab le to 
immediately retrieve and examine the record and read the information during any on -site 
visit to the pharmacy. For purposes of off -site audits and review, a separate copy of any 
sight -readable hard -copy printout or electronic readable file (such as a  PDF file) of each daily record shall be made available to a representative of the Board or GDNA upon 
verbal request by that representative. These daily prescription records can:  
1. Be generated as hard -copy print -outs at least once weekly, separated into each 24 -
hour period, by the pharmacy and maintained for at least two years after the last 
date on which the prescription was filled or refilled. If a hard -copy printout of each 
day's  filled and refilled prescription is generated, that printout shall be verified, 
dated, and signed by the individual pharmacist who refilled such a prescription 
order. The individual pharmacist must verify that the data indicated are correct and 
then sign this document in the same manner as he would sign a check or legal 
document (e.g., J.H. Smith, or John H. Smith). This document shall be maintained 
in a separate file at that pharmacy for a period of two years from the dispensing 
date; or  
2. Be maintained electronically. The computers on which the records are maintained 
may be located at another location, but the records must be immediately retrievable 
as hard -copy print -outs or viewing on a computer monitor set aside for such 
viewing at each individually registered pharmacy upon a verbal request by a 
representative from the Board or GDNA. The computer software must be capable 
of printing out or transferring the prescription records in a format that is readily 
understandable to the representati ve for the Board or GDNA at the registered 
location. Prescription records must also be sortable and retrievable by prescriber 
name, patient name, drug dispensed, and date filled. When utilizing electronic daily 
prescription fill and refill records, each ph armacy shall maintain a bound log book, 
or separate file, in which each individual pharmacist involved in such dispensing 
shall sign a statement each day, attesting to the fact that the prescription 
information entered by him or her into the computer that day has been reviewed by 
him or her and is correct as shown. Such a book or file must be maintained at the 
pharmacy employing such software for a period of two years after the date of 
dispensing the appropriately authorized refill.  
 
(c) The information maintained by the automated electronic data processing system shall 
include, but not be limited to the following:  
1. Date of dispensing;  
2. Prescription number;  
3. Patient's name;  
4. Patient's address;  
5. Drug name, strength, and dosage form;  
6. Quantity prescribed, and if the quantity dispensed is different from the quantity 
prescribed, the quantity dispensed;  7. Prescriber's name;  
8. Identification of dispensing pharmacist;  
9. Indication whether drugs are being dispensed pursuant to a new prescription or for 
a refill order;  
10. In case of a controlled substance as allowed by federal law, the name, address and 
DEA registration of the practitioner and the schedule of the drug;  
11. Directions for administration of the prescription to the patient; and  
12. Total number of refills authorized.  
 
(d) Permanent records of electronic prescriptions for dangerous drugs and controlled 
substances do not have to be reduced to hard copy provided the following requirements 
are met:  
1. Electronic prescription data must be maintained in the original format received for 
a minimum of two years; and  
2. Reliable backup copies of the information are readily retrievable and stored in a 
secure and fireproof (minimum 1 hr. UL approved) container, stored in a secured 
offsite location or backed up to a documented offsite secure storage device within 
48 hours fo llowing each work -day. 
 
(e) The individual pharmacist responsible for completeness and accuracy of the entries to the 
system must provide documentation that prescription information entered into the 
computer is correct, by dating and signing the print -out in the same manner as signing a 
check or legal document (e.g., Mary A. Smith or M. A. Smith).  
(f) An auxiliary record -keeping system shall be established for the documentation of filling 
new prescriptions, refills, and transfers if the automated electronic data processing system 
is inoperative for any reason. The auxiliary system shall insure that all refills are 
authorized by the original prescription and that the maximum number of refills is not 
exceeded. When this automated electronic data processing system is restored to operation, 
the information regarding prescriptions filled and refilled during t he inoperative period 
shall be entered into the automated electronic data processing system as soon as possible. 
However, nothing in this section shall preclude the pharmacist from using his/her 
professional judgment for the benefit of a patient's health a nd safety.  
(g) Any pharmacy using an automated electronic data processing system must comply with 
all applicable State and Federal laws and regulations.  
(h) A pharmacy shall make arrangements with the supplier of data processing services or

under this part, "Prescription Drug Order" is defined to mean the lawful order of a

(iv) Drug -Drug interactions;  
(v) incorrect Drug dosage or duration of Drug treatment;  
(vi) Drug -allergy interactions;  (vii) clinical abuse/misuse.  
 
2. Upon recognizing any of the above, the Pharmacist shall take appropriate steps to 
avoid or resolve the problem which shall, if necessary, include consultation with 
the Practitioner.  
 
(c) Patient Counseling.  
1. Upon receipt of a Prescription Drug Order and following a review of the patient's 
record, the dispensing Pharmacist shall personally offer to discuss matters which 
will enhance or optimize drug therapy with each patient or caregiver of such 
patient. If the  prescription is being delivered, then the personal offer to counsel may 
be made verbally or in written format. A written offer must provide a telephone 
number and business hours during which a pharmacist can be reached. Such 
discussion shall be in person,  whenever practicable, or by telephone and shall 
include appropriate elements of patient counseling, based on the professional 
judgment of the pharmacist. Such elements may include but are not limited to the 
following:

(ii) the dosage form, dose, route of Administration, and duration of drug 
therapy;  
(iii) intended use of the Drug and expected action;  
(iv) special directions and precautions for preparation, Administration, and use 
by the patient;  
(v) common severe side or adverse effects or interactions and therapeutic 
contraindications that may be encountered, including their avoidance, and

any other information peculiar to the specific patient or Drug.  
 
2. Additional forms of patient information shall be used to supplement Patient

professionals are authorized to administer the drug(s).  
(ii) inmates of correctional institutions where pharmacy services are provided 
by the Georgia Department of Corrections or by county or municipal 
political subdivisions either directly or by a subcontractor of the above; or  
(iii) patients receiving drugs from the Georgia Department of Human Resources 
Division of Public Health; provided however, that pharmacists who provide 
medications to patients in accordance with Section 43-34-26.1 of the 
Official Code of Georgia Annotated shall include in all dispensing 
procedures a written process whereby the patient or the caregiver of such 
patient is provided with the information contained in Chapter 480 -31 of the 
Rules of the Georgia State Boar d of Pharmacy.  
(iv) refills of prescription drug orders for which, in the professional judgment of 
the Pharmacist, appropriate counseling has taken place or has been 
declined. The need for counseling on refills resides in the professional 
judgment of the dispensing Pharmacist.  
 
4. A Pharmacist shall not be required to counsel a patient or caregiver when the 
patient or caregiver refuses such consultation.  
5. These rules will become effective January 1, 1993.
