INTRODUCTION
 
The purpose of this booklet is to

the Florida laws and rules
,
 
of 
which the Board of 
Pharmacy
, the Department of Health
,
 
and Florida

All of the Florida statutes and administrative rules mentioned in this introduction are not 
included in this
 
booklet but 
may be easily provided upon request
. (Those in bold are included.)
 
Chapter 46
5
, Florida Statutes, is the law which governs the 
practice of 
pharmacy
 
in the State 
of Florida.
 
In addition to the law, the Board promulgates rules to further define the mandate of 
the law.
 
Chapter 
64B16
,
 
Florida Administrative Code, includes the rules promulgated by the
 
Board of 
Pharm
acy
.
 
The Board is required by law to promulgate certain rules to implement specific
 
mandates with 
Chapters 46
5
, 45
6
, and 120, 
Florida Statutes
. From these statutes, 
the
 
B
oard 
has 
been delegated 
specific authority to
 
promulgate other rules 
so 
long as the rules are 
consistent
 
with the laws.
 
Chapter 456, Florida Statutes, is the law that governs the Department of Health. Within Chapter 
456, the
 
Department’s and the Board’s scopes interrelate and intertwine
.
 
The 
Board must/may 
promulgate
 
rules 
for the purposes of carrying out th
e mandate
s set forth in 
Chapter 456.
 
Chapter 120, Florida Statutes, is the Administrative Procedures Act. The purpose of the act is to 
ensure
 
that the general public has access to information regarding the functions and duties of 
administrative
 
bodie
s, e.g. Board of 
Pharmacy 
and Department of Health, whose actions may 
affect the interests of
 
private citizens.
 
Under Chapter 120, The Administration Commission (the Governor and Cabinet) has adopted 
model rules
 
(Chapter 28) by which agencies are required
 
to abide when dealing with 
rulemaking and hearing
 
procedures to the extent that each agency does not adopt a specific 
rule of procedure covering the
 
subject matter material contained in the model rules applicable 
to that agency.

Standards of practice.
—
 
(1)
 
Consistent with the provisions of this act, the board shall adopt by rule standards of practice relating to the 
practice of pharmacy which shall be binding 
on every state agency and shall be applied by such agencies when 
enforcing or implementing any authority granted by any applicable statute, rule, or regulation, whether federal or 
state.
 
(2)(a)
 
Before dispensing a controlled substance to a person not known
 
to the pharmacist, the pharmacist must 
require the person purchasing, receiving, or otherwise acquiring the controlled substance to present valid 
photographic identification or other verification of his or her identity. If the person does not have proper 
identification, the pharmacist may verify the validity of the prescription and the identity of the patient with the 
prescriber or his or her authorized agent. Verification of health plan eligibility through a real
-
time inquiry or 
adjudication system is con
sidered to be proper identification.
 
(b)
 
This subsection does not apply in an institutional setting or to a long
-
term care facility, including, but not 
limited to, an assisted living facility or a hospital to which patients are admitted.
 
(c)
 
As used in thi

ting services on the premises to patients of that institution, for use on the premises of that institution. 
However, an institutional pharmacy located in an area or county included in an emergency order or proclamation 
of a state of emergency declared by t
he Governor may provide dispensing and consulting services to individuals 
who are not patients of the institution. However, a single dose of a medicinal drug may be obtained and

ion of a physician or charge nurse, 
consistent with good institutional practice procedures. The obtaining and administering of such single dose of a 
medicinal drug shall be pursuant to drug
-
handling procedures established by a consultant pharmacist. Medici
nal 
drugs may be dispensed in a Class II institutional pharmacy, but only in accordance with the provisions of this 
section.
 
(c)
 
“Modified Class II institutional pharmacies” are those institutional pharmacies in short
-

treatment centers t
hat meet all the requirements for a Class II permit, except space and equipment 
requirements.

medicinal drugs in this state may dispense up to a 24
-
hour supply of a medicinal drug to any patient of an 
emergency department of a hospital that operates a Class II or Class III institutional pharmacy, provided that the 
physician treating the patient in 
such hospital’s emergency department determines that the medicinal drug is 
warranted and that community pharmacy services are not readily accessible, geographically or otherwise, to the 
patient. Such dispensing from the emergency department must be in acco
rdance with the procedures of the 
hospital. For any such patient for whom a medicinal drug is warranted for a period to exceed 24 hours, an 
individual licensed to prescribe such drug must dispense a 24
-
hour supply of such drug to the patient and must 
provi
de the patient with a prescription for such drug for use after the initial 24
-
hour period. The board may adopt 
rules necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.
 
(5)
 
All institutional pharmacies shall be under the professional supervision of a
 
consultant pharmacist, and the 
compounding and dispensing of medicinal drugs shall be done only by a licensed pharmacist. Every institutional 
pharmacy that employs or otherwise uses registered pharmacy technicians shall have a written policy and 
procedure

approval of the medical staff f
or the purpose of identifying those medicinal drugs, proprietary preparations, 
biologics, biosimilars, and biosimilar interchangeables that may be dispensed by the pharmacists employed in 
such institution. A facility with a Class II or Class III institutio
nal pharmacy permit which is operating under the 
formulary system shall establish policies and procedures for the development of the system in accordance with 
the joint standards of the American Hospital Association and American Society of Hospital Pharmac
ists for the 
utilization of a hospital formulary system, which formulary shall be approved by the medical staff.

Medicinal drugs stored in bulk or 
unit of use in an automated pharmacy system servicing a long
-

(c)
 
“Prescriber” means any practitioner licensed to prescribe medicinal drugs.
 
(2)
 
A pharmacist who receives a 
prescription for a brand name drug shall, unless requested otherwise by the

Distributed by a business entity doing business, and subject to suit and service of legal p
rocess, in the 
United States; and
 
(b)
 
Listed in the formulary of generic and brand name drug products as provided in subsection (5) for the brand 
name drug prescribed,
 
unless the prescriber writes the words “MEDICALLY NECESSARY,” in her or his own handwrit
ing, on the face of a 
written prescription; unless, in the case of an oral prescription, the prescriber expressly indicates to the 
pharmacist that the brand name drug prescribed is medically necessary; or unless, in the case of a prescription 
that is elect
ronically generated and transmitted, the prescriber makes an overt act when transmitting the 
prescription to indicate that the brand name drug prescribed is medically necessary. When done in conjunction 
with the electronic transmission of the prescription,
 
the prescriber’s overt act indicates to the pharmacist that the 
brand name drug prescribed is medically necessary.
 
(3)(a)
 
Any pharmacist who substitutes any drug as provided in subsection (2) shall notify the person presenting 
the prescription of such sub
stitution, together with the existence and amount of the retail price difference 
between the brand name drug and the drug substituted for it, and shall inform the person presenting the 
prescription that such person may refuse the substitution as provided i
n subsection (2).
 
(b)
 
Any pharmacist substituting a less expensive drug product shall pass on to the consumer the full amount of 
the savings realized by such substitution.
 
(4)
 
Each pharmacist shall maintain a record of any substitution of a generically equ
ivalent drug product for a 
prescribed brand name drug as provided in this section.
 
(5)
 
Each community pharmacy shall establish a formulary of generic and brand name drug products which, if 
selected as the drug product of choice, would not pose a threat to 
the health and safety of patients receiving 
prescription medication. In compiling the list of generic and brand name drug products for inclusion in the 
formulary, the pharmacist shall rely on drug product research, testing, information, and formularies com
piled by 
other pharmacies, by states, by the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, by the United 
States Department of Health and Human Services, or by any other source which the pharmacist deems reliable. 
Each community pharmacy shall
 
make such formulary available to the public, the Board of Pharmacy, or any 
physician requesting same. This formulary shall be revised following each addition, deletion, or modification of 
said formulary.
 
(6)
 
The Board of Pharmacy and the Board of Medicine
 
shall establish by rule a formulary of generic drug type 
and brand name drug products which are determined by the boards to demonstrate clinically significant biological 
or therapeutic inequivalence and which, if substituted, would pose a threat to the he
alth and safety of patients 
receiving prescription medication.
 
(a)
 
The formulary may be added to or deleted from as the Board of Pharmacy and the Board of Medicine deem 
appropriate. Any person who requests any inclusion, addition, or deletion of a generic 
drug type or brand name 
drug product to the formulary shall have the burden of proof to show cause why such inclusion, addition, or 
deletion should be made.

modification to the formulary, the Board of Pharmacy shall mail a copy to each manager of the prescription 
department of each community pharmacy licensed by the state, each nonresident pharmacy registered in the 
state, and each board regulating practitio
ners licensed by the laws of the state to prescribe drugs shall 
incorporate such formulary into its rules. No pharmacist shall substitute a generically equivalent drug product for 
a prescribed brand name drug product if the brand name drug product or the g
eneric drug type drug product is 
included in the said formulary.
 
(7)
 
Every community pharmacy shall display in a prominent place that is in clear and unobstructed public view, 
at or near the place where prescriptions are dispensed, a sign in block letters 
not less than 1 inch in height which 
shall read: “CONSULT YOUR PHARMACIST CONCERNING THE AVAILABILITY OF A LESS EXPENSIVE 
GENERICALLY EQUIVALENT DRUG AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF FLORIDA LAW.”
 
(8)
 
The standard of care to be applied to the acts of any pharmacist
 
performing professional services in 
compliance with this section when a substitution is made by said pharmacist shall be that which would apply to 
the performance of professional services in the dispensing of a prescription order prescribing a drug by gen
eric 
name. In no event when a pharmacist substitutes a drug shall the prescriber be liable in any action for loss, 
damage, injury, or death to any person occasioned by or arising from the use or nonuse of the substituted drug, 
unless the original drug was 
incorrectly prescribed.

refilled, nor shall another medicinal drug be ordered for the same condition unless such act is consistent with 
dispensing proced
ures established by the committee. Appropriate referral to another health care provider is 
indicated under such circumstances. On each occasion of such dispensing, the pharmacist shall create and 
maintain a prescription record in the form required by law.

The agency conducting the audit must give the pharmacist at least 1 week’s prior notice of the initial audit 
for each audit cycle.
 
(b)
 
An audit must be conducted by a pharmacist licensed in this state.
 
(c)
 
Any clerical or recordkeeping
 
error, such as a typographical error, scrivener’s error, or computer error 
regarding a document or record required under the Medicaid program does not constitute a willful violation and is 
not subject to criminal penalties without proof of intent to commi
t fraud.
 
(d)
 
A pharmacist may use the physician’s record or other order for drugs or medicinal supplies written or 
transmitted by any means of communication for purposes of validating the pharmacy record with respect to 
orders or refills of a legend or nar
cotic drug.
 
(e)
 
A finding of an overpayment or underpayment must be based on the actual overpayment or underpayment 
and may not be a projection based on the number of patients served having a similar diagnosis or on the number 
of similar orders or refills 
for similar drugs.
 
(f)
 
Each pharmacy shall be audited under the same standards and parameters.
 
(g)
 
A pharmacist must be allowed at least 10 days in which to produce documentation to address any 
discrepancy found during an audit.

Definition of Compounding.
 
“Compounding” is the 
professional act by a pharmacist or other practitioner authorized by law, employing the 
science or art of any branch of the profession of pharmacy, incorporating ingredients to create a finished product 
for dispensing to a patient or for administration by 
a practitioner or the practitioner’s agent; and shall specifically 
include the professional act of preparing a unique finished product containing any ingredient or device defined by 
Sections 465.003(7) and (8), F.S. The term also includes the preparation o
f nuclear pharmaceuticals and diagnostic 
kits incident to use of such nuclear pharmaceuticals. The term “commercially available products,” as used in this 
section, means any medicinal product as defined by Sections 465.003(7) and (8), F.S., that are legall
y distributed 
in the State of Florida by a drug manufacturer or wholesaler.
 
(1) Compounding includes:
 
(a) The preparation of drugs or devices in anticipation of prescriptions based on routine, regularly observed 
prescribing patterns.
 
(b) The preparation pu
rsuant to a prescription of drugs or devices which are not commercially available.
 
(c) The preparation of commercially available products from bulk when the prescribing practitioner has 
prescribed the compounded product on a per prescription basis and the 
patient has been made aware that the 
compounded product will be prepared by the pharmacist. The reconstitution of commercially available products 
pursuant to the manufacturer’s guidelines is permissible without notice to the practitioner.
 
(2) The preparati
on of drugs or devices for sale or transfer to pharmacies, practitioners, or entities for purposes 
of dispensing or distribution is not compounding and is not within the practice of the profession of pharmacy, except 
that the supply of patient specific com
pounded prescriptions to another pharmacy under the provisions of Section 
465.0265, F.S., and Rule 64B16
-
28.450, F.A.C., is authorized.

The Standards of Practice for Compounding Sterile Products.
 
The purpose of this section is to assure positive patient outcomes 
through the provision of standards for 1) 
pharmaceutical care; 2) the preparation, labeling, and distribution of sterile pharmaceuticals by pharmacies, 
pursuant to or in anticipation of a prescription drug order; and 3) product quality and characteristics.
 
These 
standards are intended to apply to all sterile pharmaceuticals, notwithstanding the location of the patient (e.g., 
home, hospital, nursing home, hospice, doctor’s office, or ambulatory infusion center).
 
(1) Adoption of the United States Pharmacopeia
: Beginning on October 1, 2014, all sterile compounding shall 
be performed in accordance with the minimum practice and quality standards of the following chapters of the 
United States Pharmacopeia (USP):
 
(a) Chapter 797, Pharmaceutical Compounding
-
Sterile 
Preparations;
 
(b) 
Chapter 71, Sterility Tests;
 
(c) 
Chapter 85, Bacterial Endotoxins Test;
 
(d) 
Chapter 731, Loss on Drying.
 
All referenced chapters of the USP, in subsection (1), are specifically referring to the United States Pharmacopeia, 
36th revision, S
econd Supplement, which is hereby incorporated and adopted by reference with the effective 
chapter dates of December 1, 2013. A subscription to all relevant chapters is available for purchase at 
www.uspnf.com
. 
The Board
 
has determined that posting the incorporated material on the Internet would constitute 
a violation of federal copyright law. At the time of adoption, the copyrighted incorporated material will be available 
for public inspection and examination, but may no
t be copied, at the Department of Health, 4052 Bald Cypress 
Way, Tallahassee, Florida 32399
-
3254, and at the Department of State, Administrative Code and Register Section, 
Room 701, The Capitol, Tallahassee, Florida 32399
-
0250.
 
(2) Minimum Standards: The minimum practice and quality standards of the USP are adopted as the minimum  
 
Revised 01/2020 
 
 
 
Page | 
82
 
  
 
 
     
 
 
standards to be followed when sterile products are compounded. However, nothing in this rule shall be construed 
to prevent the compounding of sterile pr
oducts in accordance with standards that exceed the USP.
 
(3) Current Good Manufacturing Practices: The Board deems that this rule is complied with for any sterile 
products that are compounded in strict accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices p
er 21 U.S.C. §351 
(2012), adopted and incorporated herein by reference, available at 
https://www.flrules.org/Gateway/reference.asp?No=Ref
-
04436
 
and 21 C.F.R. Parts 210 and 211 (2013
), adopted 
and incorporated herein by reference, available at 
http://www.flrules.org/Gateway/reference.asp?No=Ref
-
04437
.
 
(4) Registered Outsourcing facilities: For any pharmacy regis
tered as an outsourcing facility, the minimum 
standards of practice for sterile compounding shall be the current good manufacturing practices as adopted in 
subsection (3).
 
(5) The board finds that the production of sterile compounded products prepared with
 
a process that includes 
the lyophilization of the sterile product may not be adequately regulated under the provisions of subsection (1). 
Sterile compounded products prepared using a process that includes lyophilization shall, in addition to all applicabl
e 
provisions of USP Chapter 797, be subject to the following additional requirements:
 
(a) Compounded sterile products prepared for lyophilization shall be maintained in ISO 5 unidirectional laminar 
flow air throughout sterilization, filling, and transport from the Primary Engineering Control (“PEC”) into the 
lyophilizer. Smoke studies shall
 
be conducted to demonstrate that transport from the PEC to the lyophilizer can be 
accomplished while maintaining ISO 5 laminar flow air at all times. The smoke study shall be recorded and available 
for inspection.
 
(b) The pharmacy shall establish, maintai
n, and follow policies and procedures for the high
-
level disinfection of 
the chamber, piping, and all other areas of the lyophilizer which pose a potential risk of contamination to the 
product.
 
(c) The pharmacy shall, initially and after any change to the 
cleaning process or agents, validate a high
-
level 
disinfection process for the lyophilizer. For the purposes of this rule, validation means that the high
-
level disinfection 
process shall be proven with validation studies performed with the 5 aerobic bacter
ial and fungal ATCC organisms 
referenced in USP Chapter 71. The validation studies must be performed by an external vendor or by an internal 
laboratory. A pharmacy with an internal laboratory shall be separated from the compounding area and the work 
area t
o prevent contamination in the pharmacy. Documentation of validation shall be readily available for inspection.
 
(d) A policy and procedure for cleaning the lyophilizer prior to high level disinfection to include cleaning agents 
and schedules shall be estab
lished. Documentation of cleaning shall be maintained and readily available for 
inspection.
 
(e) The pharmacy shall establish policies and procedures as well as a schedule for the maintenance of the 
lyophilizer, which shall be, at a minimum, based on the ma
nufacturer’s recommendations. As leakage into the 
vacuum chamber poses a risk of contamination to the product, the maintenance schedule shall include provisions 
for periodically testing for leaks along with all recommended procedures described by the equip
ment manufacturer.  
Documentation of routine maintenance shall be available for inspection.
 
(f) The pharmacy shall develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) and a quality assurance program to 
include validation of the filling process, container closure 
integrity, the frequent monitoring of fill volumes, training 
and assessment of personnel involved in all aspects of compounding sterile products for lyophilization, identification 
of overfills and underfills, equipment qualification, formula verification, 
and evaluation of the finished product for 
conformance to specifications.
 
(g) The pharmacy shall establish provisions for sterilizing the inert gas or air used for backfilling during the 
vacuum release phase. Filters shall be used to sterilize the gas or a
ir and shall undergo manufacturer’s 
recommended integrity testing. 
 
(h) Media fills shall be conducted using maximum batch sizes. The media fills shall demonstrate the filling, 
transportation to the lyophilizer, loading, and stoppering operations. Media sh
all not be frozen as part of the media 
fill as freezing of the media could reduce the ability of the media to support growth.
  
 
Revised 01/2020 
 
 
 
Page |

(i) Personnel preparing sterile compounds for lyophilization shall wear sterile Personal Protective Equipment 
(PPE) that allows al
l exposed skin to be covered.
 
(j) Personnel shall perform Glove Fingertip Sampling with each batch after the fill and transport of the vials. 
This sampling shall be documented and incorporated into the batch record.
 
(k) In
-
process acceptance criteria for e
ach lyophilized product shall be established and may include criteria 
such as color, moisture limits and visual appearance. A one hundred percent (100%) visual examination of the 
finished product shall be conducted to determine that the product conforms to
 
the established visual criteria. This 
examination shall be documented and incorporated in the batch record.
 
(l) Laboratory testing.
 
1. Finished product testing shall be conducted on all batches. Procedures for selecting samples from the batch 
for testing 
shall be written and followed.  Procedures may include location of vials in the lyophilizer (e.g. select 
from each corner and the middle of each shelf) and position in the fill line (e.g. beginning, middle, and end of fill.)
 
2. Finished product testing for
 
all batches shall include sterility testing with methods described in USP Chapter 
71 unless an alternative method has been validated and shown to be equivalent or better. Diluents for reconstituting 
the vials for testing shall be preservative free. Lyophi
lized products released with beyond use dates within USP 
Chapter 797 guidelines shall, in lieu of sterility testing, conduct viable air, surface, and personnel (gloves and 
sleeves) sampling for each batch.
 
3. Endotoxin limits shall be established for every
 
lyophilized product.
 
4. Endotoxin testing for all lyophilized batches shall be performed in accordance with USP Chapter 85 and 
confirmed to fall within the set limits.  This shall be documented on the batch record.
 
5. Potency, radiochemical purity or appl
icable test to assure label claim shall be conducted on every batch and 
documented in the batch record. In lieu of potency testing, weight
-
based verification may occur based on formula 
verification. Weight based verification will be based on ninety to one 
hundred ten percent (90% 
–
 
110%) theoretical 
yield. Potency testing shall be based on USP monograph if one is available; if not, it shall be based on ninety to 
one hundred ten percent (90% 
–
 
110%) theoretical yield.
 
6. Initial potency testing shall be esta
blished based on worst case scenario.
 
(6) Clarifications, Variances, or Exceptions to the United States Pharmacopeia:
 
(a) Although the USP requires the donning of gloves prior to entry into the clean
-
room, all required donning of 
gloves can be performed af
ter entry into the clean
-
room to avoid contamination of the gloves from the door handle 
or access device leading into the clean
-
room.
 
(b) USP Chapter 797 requires that: “When closed
-
system vial
-
transfer devices (CSTDs) (i.e., vial
-
transfer 
systems that all
ow no venting or exposure of hazardous substance to the environment) are used, they shall be 
used within an ISO Class 5 (see Table 1) environment of a BSC or CACI. The use of the CSTD is preferred because 
of their inherent closed system process. In facilit
ies that prepare a low volume of hazardous drugs, the use of two 
tiers of containment (e.g., CSTD within a BSC or CACI that is located in a non
-
negative pressure room) is 
acceptable.” For purpose of said provision, a “low volume of hazardous drugs” is defi
ned as less than 40 doses per 
month.
 
(c) USP Chapter 797 provides as follows in the “Facility Design and Environmental Controls” section: “An ISO 
Class 7 (see Table 1) buffer area and ante
-
area supplied with HEPA
-
filtered air shall receive an ACPH of not l
ess 
than 30. The PEC is a good augmentation to generating air changes in the air supply of an area but cannot be the 
sole source of HEPA
-
filtered air. If the area has an ISO Class 5 (see Table 1) recirculating devise, a minimum of 15 
ACPHs through the area
 
supply HEPA filters is adequate, providing the combined ACPH is not less than 30. More 
air changes may be required, depending on the number of personnel and processes. HEPA
-
filtered supply air shall 
be introduced at the ceiling, and returns should be moun
ted low on the wall, creating a general top
-
down dilution 
of area air with HEPA
-
filtered make
-
up air. Ceiling
-
mounted returns are not recommended.” Notwithstanding the 
quoted provision, pharmacies that meet the standards set forth in the section quotes as 
of the effective date of this 
rule are not required to change the location of supply air or return filters or ducts so long as the ISO standards are 
maintained.

(d) USP Chapter 797 provides in part that the compounding facility’s ceiling tiles located in t
he ante
-
area, buffer 
area, and clean room that consist of inlaid panels “shall be impregnated with a polymer to render them impervious 
and hydrophobic, and they shall be caulked around each perimeter to seal them to the support frame.” A pharmacy 
shall not
 
be required to caulk the inlaid ceiling tiles to the perimeter of the support frame if the following are met:
 
1. The ceiling tiles are specifically manufactured to be utilized in a facility that must meet and maintain an 
airborne particulate 
cleanliness of ISO Class 7 or better.
 
2. The core of the ceiling tiles are sealed on the front, back, and all edges to render them impervious and 
hydrophobic, so they can be properly maintained and cleaned as required by this rule.
 
3. The ceiling tiles are
 
inlaid or installed using a gasket grid sealing system, which is manufactured for use in 
facilities that must meet and maintain an airborne particulate cleanliness of ISO Class 7 or better. The sealing 
system must create and maintain a positive seal betwe
en the ceiling tiles and the support frame and the seal 
between the ceiling tiles and support frame shall be secured with retention clips.

laboratory values ordered for a patient, execute drug therapy orders for a patient, and notify the physician.
 
(2) “Drug Therapy Management” means any act or service by a pharmacist in compliance with orders in a 
Prescriber Care Plan.
 
(3) A pharmacist may provide Drug Therapy Management services for a patient, incidental to the dispensing of 
medicinal drugs or as a part of consulting concerning therapeutic values of medicinal drugs or as part of managing 
and monito
ring the patient’s drug therapy. A pharmacist who provides Drug Therapy Management services for a 
patient shall comply with orders in a Prescriber Care Plan, insofar as they specify:
 
(a) Drug therapy to be initially dispensed to the patient by the pharmaci
st, or
 
(b) Laboratory values or tests to be ordered, monitored and interpreted by the pharmacist, or
 
(c) The conditions under which the duly licensed practitioner authorizes the execution of subsequent orders 
concerning the drug therapy for the patient, or

Standards of Practice for the 
Filling of Controlled Substance Prescriptions; 
Electronic Prescribing; Mandatory Continuing Education
.
 
The Board of Pharmacy recognizes that it is 
important for the patients of the State of Florida to be able to fill valid 
prescriptions for controlled substances. In filling these prescriptions, the Board does not expect pharmacists to take 
any specific action beyond exercising sound professional judg
ment. Pharmacists should not fear disciplinary action 
from the Board or other regulatory or enforcement agencies for dispensing controlled substances for a legitimate 
medical purpose in the usual course of professional practice. Every patient’s situation i
s unique and prescriptions 
for controlled substances shall be reviewed with each patient’s unique situation in mind. Pharmacists shall attempt 
to work with the patient and the prescriber to assist in determining the validity of the prescription.
 
(1)
 
Defini
tions: For purposes of this rule the following definitions shall apply:
 
(a) Valid Prescription. A prescription is valid when it is based on a practitioner
-
patient relationship and when it 
has been issued for a legitimate medical purpose.
 
(b) Invalid Prescr
iption. A prescription is invalid if the pharmacist knows or has reason to know that the 
prescription was not issued for a legitimate medical purpose.
 
(c) Validating a Prescription. Validating a prescription means the process implemented by the pharmacist 
to 
determine that the prescription was issued for a legitimate medical purpose.
 
(2) General Standards for Validating a Prescription: Each prescription may require a different validation process 
and no singular process can fit each situation that may be pre
sented to the pharmacist. There are circumstances 
that may cause a pharmacist to question the validity of a prescription for a controlled substance; however, a concern 
with the validity of a prescription does not mean the prescription shall not be filled. 
Rather, when a pharmacist is 
presented with a prescription for a controlled substance, the pharmacist shall attempt to determine the validity of 
the prescription and shall attempt to resolve any concerns about the validity of the prescription by exercising
 
his or  
 
Revised 01/2020 
 
 
 
Page | 
87
 
  
 
 
     
 
 
her independent professional judgment.
 
(a) When validating a prescription, neither a person nor a licensee shall interfere with the exercise of the 
pharmacist’s independent professional judgment.
 
(b) When validating a prescription, the pharmacist s
hall ensure that all communication with the patient is not 
overheard by others.
 
(c) When validating a prescription, if at any time the pharmacist determines that in his or her professional 
judgment, concerns with the validity of the prescription cannot be 
resolved, the pharmacist shall refuse to fill or

by such persons. It is below the standard of practice and prohibited fo
r a pharmacist to delegate or assign activities,

28.2021 Change of Ownership.
 
(1) A pharmacy permit is not transferable. If upon the sale of an existing pharmacy, 
there is any change in the 
identity of the natural person, partn
ership, or business entity which holds the permit, a new application must be 
filed and a new permit obtained. For purposes of this rule, the test for determining change of identity shall be 
whether the person or entity’s Federal Employer Identification Num
ber (FEIN) remains the same following the sale.
 
(2) Permits held by business entities with no change in identity. In those cases where the permit is held by a 
business entity (e.g. a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, etc.) 
which entity continues to 
hold the permit without change in identity, the transfer of the ownership interests of said business entity to another 
person or business entity does not constitute a change of ownership (requiring application for and issuance of 
a 
new pharmacy permit)
. Upon transfer of the ownership interests in the business entity, the following steps shall be 
taken:
 
(a) Within fifteen (15) days of closing the transfer, the permittee shall notify the Board office of the transfer of 
ownership inte
rests; and,
 
(b) As specified in Section 465.022(3), F.S., all persons, members, partners, officers, directors, and agents having 
an ownership or other financial interest of greater than five percent (5%), and all persons who directly or indirectly  
 
Revised 01/2020

manage, 
oversee, or control the operation of the business entity, must file with the board a set of fingerprints as 
specified in paragraph 64B16
-
28.100(1)(c), F.A.C.
 
(3) If a criminal history check identifies any person listed in paragraph (2)(b) above, as meeting
 
any of the provisions 
of Section 465.022(5) or (6), F.S.,
 
the Board staff shall refer the matter to the Department for investigation and 
possible prosecution as provided in Section 465.023, F.S.
 
(4) A change in ownership (and issuance of a new permit numb
er) requires that new records be started and old 
records closed. The process for closing a pharmacy, including the transfer of prescription files and medicinal drugs, 
as outlined in Rules 64B16
-
28.202 and 64B16
-
28.203, F.A.C., must be followed for the old 
permit. If the old permit 
has controlled substances, the new permit must record an “opening inventory” for DEA purposes. Both the new 
permit and the old permit must keep appropriate records for four (4) years for the transfer of legend drugs and 
controlled
 
substances.
 
(5) A change in the company or person who leases the building where the permit is housed or a change in the 
management company which contracts with the owner of the permit for the operation of the permit does not 
constitute a change in ownersh
ip.

and the transfer inventory of the transferee entity. The transferor and tr
ansferee shall each retain a copy of the 
inventory in their records and shall provide the Board of Pharmacy with a copy of such inventory. Transfer of any 
controlled substance in Schedule II shall require the use of order form, D.E.A. form number 222.
 
(5) 
Unless the permittee
-
transferor is informed by the Board of Pharmacy or the regional D.E.A. Administrator prior 
to the date on which the transfer was stated to occur, that the transfer may not occur, the permittee
-
transferor 
may proceed with the transfer.

Circumstances
.
 
(1) The board sets forth below a range of disciplinary guidelines from which disciplinary penalties will be imposed 
upon licensees guilty of violating chapters 456, 465
, 499, or 893 or section 828.055, F.S. The purpose of the 
disciplinary guidelines is to give notice to licensees of the range of penalties which will normally be imposed upon 
violations of particular provisions of chapters 456, 465, 499, 893 or section 828
.055, F.S. The term license means 
any permit, registration, certificate, or license, including a provisional license, issued by the Department. Penalty 
ranges are shown as minimum and maximum guidelines as well as for first time single count violations and
 
for 
multiple or repeated violations of the same statutory provision or the rules promulgated thereunder. If an actual 
range of penalties is not provided, the listed penalty shall be the guideline penalty for the violation(s) unless 
aggravating or mitigati
ng factors are shown. All penalties at the upper range of the sanctions set forth in the 
guidelines, e.g., suspension, revocation, etc., include lesser penalties, e.g., fine, continuing education, probation, 
or reprimand, which may be included in the final
 
penalty at the board’s discretion. Probation may be subject to 
conditions, including restriction from practice in certain settings, restricting the licensee to working only under 
designated conditions or in certain settings, requiring continuing or remedi
al education, or any other restriction 
found to be necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. In addition to any other discipline 
imposed under these guidelines, the board shall assess costs relating to the investigation and pr
osecution of the 
case.
 
(2) The following disciplinary guidelines shall be followed by the board in imposing disciplinary penalties upon 
licensees and permittees for violation of the below mentioned statutes and rules. For the purposes of this rule, the

32.015 Nonresident Sterile Compounding Permit Inspections; Approved Inspection 
Entities.
 
All applicants for a nonresident sterile compounding permit must have and present a current and satisfactory 
inspection report, and all nonresident sterile 
compounding permit holders seeking biennial renewal of the permit 
must have and present a current and satisfactory inspection report, as mandated by Section 465.0158, F.S.
 
(1) Current and Satisfactory Inspection Report: An inspection report is current if t
he inspection report 
establishes that the inspection took place within the time frames established in Section 465.0158(3)(e), F.S. An 
inspection report will be deemed satisfactory when the report reflects that the applicant or permit holder compounds 
all s
terile products in compliance with minimum practice and quality standards (minimum standards). The minimum 
standards are different for those who are only registered as a nonresident pharmacy pursuant to Section 465.0156, 
F.S., and for those who are registe
red as an outsourcing facility pursuant to Section 21 U.S.C. 353b.
 
(2) Minimum Standards: Applicants for an initial permit or applicants for biennial renewal that are both a 
registered nonresident pharmacy and a registered outsourcing facility must meet th
e minimum standards applicable 
to a registered outsourcing facility.
 
(a) Registered Outsourcing Facility: The minimum standards for a registered outsourcing facility are the Current 
Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) that are adopted and incorporated by r
eference in subsection 64B16
-
27.797(3), F.A.C.
 
(b) Registered Nonresident Pharmacies: The minimum standards for a registered nonresident pharmacy are 
Chapters 797, 71, 85, and 731 of the United States Pharmacopeia that are adopted and incorporated by refer
ence 
in subsection 64B16
-
27.797(1), F.A.C.
 
(3) Mandatory State Inspection Report: The current and satisfactory inspection report must be generated from 
an inspection that is performed by the regulatory or licensing authority of the state, territory, or dis
trict (hereinafter 
“state”) where the applicant is geographically located, unless the applicant meets the acceptable circumstances 
established herein. The board hereby deems the following as acceptable circumstances for the department’s 
acceptance of a cur
rent and satisfactory inspection report performed pursuant to Sections 465.0158(3)(e)1.
-
3., 
F.S., in lieu of the state inspection report:
 
(a) In the event that state or federal law prohibits the submission of the state inspection report;
 
(b) In the event t
hat the state refuses to perform the inspection or generates an inspection report after 
completion of the inspection;
  
 
Revised 01/2020 
 
 
 
Page | 
166
 
  
 
 
     
 
 
(c) In the event that the state is unable to perform an inspection within a reasonable time period from the date 
requested. Reasonable tim
e period means within 180 days from the date that the applicant requested an inspection 
be performed. A failure by the applicant to request an inspection within 180 days from the date of permit renewal 
is deemed not to be an acceptable circumstance;
 
(d) In
 
the event that the state inspection report documents that the applicant fails to meet the minimum 
standards adopted in this rule or when the inspection report merely lists an overall pass or fail and does not have 
the minimum standards enumerated within t
he inspection report with an appropriate indication of pass, fail, or not 
applicable, next to each enumerated standard;
 
(e) In the event the state inspection report would not be admissible in an administrative proceeding pursuant 
to the provisions of Chapt
er 120, F.S., or when state or federal inspectors advise they will not testify to the contents, 
results thereof, or authentication of the state inspection report;
 
(f) In the event that the applicant is able to submit a current inspection report from the Un
ited States Food and 
Drug Administration that concludes or establishes the applicant is in compliance with cGMP.
 
(4) Approved Inspection Entities for Registered Nonresident Pharmacies: This section is not applicable to 
inspection reports for registered out
sourcing facilities. The board must approve entities for which the department 
will accept a current and satisfactory inspection report in lieu of an onsite inspection by the department or an 
inspection by the licensing or regulatory authority of the state,
 
territory, or district where the applicant is located. 
An entity that wants to be approved as an inspection entity must submit an Approval Request with attached 
documentation to the board office. The Approval Request, and attached documentation, shall dem

purposes. An Approval Request must be submitted with business formation documents that establish 
compliance 
with this paragraph;
 
(b) The entity is formed, established, or created to avoid a reoccurring conflict of interest between the entity 
and those whom the entity will be inspecting. A conflict of interest is a real or seeming incompatibility betwe
en the 
entity’s private interests and the entity’s duty to conduct an impartial inspection;
 
(c) The entity will not conduct any inspection in which the entity or an employed inspector of the entity has a 
conflict of interest;
 
(d) The entity must have a cus
tomized inspection report. The inspection report must enumerate all minimum 
standards of each of the chapters of the United States Pharmacopeia that are listed in paragraph (2)(b), of this 
rule. Each enumerated minimum standard must have a place for the in
spector to mark compliant or yes; non
-
compliant, deficient or no; and not applicable. Each enumerated minimum standard must also have room for the 
inspector to document observations or comments. An Approval Request must be submitted with a copy of the 
cust
omized inspection report;
 
(e) The entity must submit any completed inspection report with digital photography capturing each 
enumerated minimum standard if the enumerated minimum standard is subject to being captured by photography;
 
(f) With the Approval R
equest, the entity must submit an inspection history report. The inspection history report 
must reflect that the applicant has experience performing inspections for compliance with the required minimum 
standards. To be approved, an entity must have a minim
um of 2 years’ experience performing inspections and 
must have performed a minimum of 20 inspections. The required inspection experience may be demonstrated 
through the experience of the employed inspectors, if the entity has not been in existence for 2 ye

submitting an Approval Request;
 
(g) The entity must agree in writing that the entity will not make a recommendation for the granting, denial, 
or discipline of a permit;

Approv
al Request. The policies and procedures shall require the inspections to be unannounced and that the costs 
of any inspection shall not be based on or differ in the amount based on the results of the inspection;
 
(i) The entity must agree in writing that it 
will testify to the contents of the inspection report in any civil, 
criminal, or administrative proceeding and that the entity agrees that it and any employed inspectors will not request

inspector who performed the inspection;
 
(j) The entity shall maintain all inspection reports and related records for a period of no less than 4 years from 
the date inspection was concluded;
 
(k) The entity shall, within 60 days prior to closing, notify the
 
department or the board when it will close or 
cease performing inspection services and make arrangements with the department for preserving inspections

(5) Employed Inspectors: The entities’ 
employed inspectors must meet the following criteria:
 
(a) Any employed inspector must hold an active license to practice pharmacy in any state, territory or district 
of the United States. Proof of the license shall be submitted with the Approval Request. T
he employed inspectors 
may not have any disciplinary history related to the practice of a health profession within 5 years prior to the 
Approval Request and may have never been disciplined for an offense related to compounding. This provision shall 
not pro
hibit the entity from retaining or employing any person that does not hold a pharmacy license for the 
purposes of assisting the inspectors. For example, it is acceptable to hire a microbiologist or chemist to assist the 
inspectors in completing the inspect
ion and inspection report;
 
(b) Any employed inspector must have a minimum of 4 years’ experience in the practice of sterile compounding. 
At least 2 of the 4 years of experience must be obtained through the active practice of compounding sterile products

training related to sterile compounding
 
and performing sterile compounding inspections. At a minimum, the training 
must consist of at least 10 clock hours of training annually. The training documentation shall be made available to 
the board upon written request.
 
(6) Once an entity is approved b
y the board, the applicant will be required to maintain compliance with the 
provisions of this rule or the approval is subject to revocation in compliance with the provisions of Chapter 120, 
F.S. The department will randomly require documentation of each a
pproved entity to ensure continued compliance 
with the provision of this rule.
 
(7) All approved entities shall be listed on the Department’s website.
